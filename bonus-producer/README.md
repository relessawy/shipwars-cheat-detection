# Producer

Randomly generates e-commerce orders and sends them to a configured Kafka instance.

## Configuration

Environment variables are used to configure this application.

* LOG_LEVEL (default: `info`) - Supports `trace`, `debug`, `info`, or `warn`
* HTTP_PORT (default: `8080`)
* KAFKA_CLIENT_ID (default: `shot-producer`)
* KAFKA_TOPIC (default: `shots`)

Service Binding is used to inject Kafka configuration. During local development
you can configure Service Binding y creating the following files inside *.bindings/kafka/*

* bootstrapServers: Single line with bootstrap server URL
* user: Single line with the Service Account ID
* password: Single line with the Service Account Secret

## HTTP API

This service exposes a HTTP API on port 8080. It accepts a `GET` request to
`/bonus`. Use this endpoint to place randomly generated bonus shot payload into Kafka.

## Usage

### Local Development

Start a local Kafka and Zookeeper using the compose file in the root of this
repository.

```bash
# Start kafka using the docker-compose.yml in
docker-compose up
```

Now start the Node.js server in local development mode. It will automatically
reload when `js` files are saved.

```
npm run dev
```

### Local Deployment

Set the appropriate environment variables and run the service via `npm start`.
Environment variables can be defined in a `.env` file in the *producer/* folder
if you'd like to avoid setting them in the shell.
